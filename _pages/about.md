Currently I am researching the economic and technical foundations of progress in computing as a Post-doc at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), and the MIT Sloan School of Management Initiative on the Digital Economy; [FutureTech][future-tech] research project headed by Prof. Neil Thompson.  
This position is parallelled with being an Adiunkt at the University of Warsaw, [Digital Economy Lab (DELab)][delab] and the Department of Technology Transformation headed by Prof. Katarzyna Åšledziewska.

I have also been a lecturer of graduate and post-graduate university courses related to machine learning algorithms, AI strategy and business. I strive to continue to be an active academic mentor to younger scholars at the cross-roads of machine learning, finance, entrepreneurship, and strategic management. 

For five years I've been an R&D Data Scientist in the banking/financial and business education accreditation industries, developing and improving machine learning models. 

I hold PhD in Business Economics, and Advanced Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (spec. Engineering & CS), both from prestigious KU Leuven, Belgium. 

In my spare time I love doing sports; karate (JKA 1st Dan Black Belt), high-intensity fitness, cross country skiing in the wintertime, and table tennis all year round. Next to that, when I am away from the screen I enjoy listening to audiobooks, jazz music and admiring art.
