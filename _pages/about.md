I am an R&D Data Scientist, currently in the financial industry, with over eight years of international experience in machine learning and statistical modelling, both in the industry and academia. 

I have been also a lecturer of graduate and post-graduate university courses related to machine learning algorithms, AI and business. I continue to be an active academic researcher at the cross-roads of machine learning, finance, entrepreneurship, and strategy. 

I hold PhD in Business Economics, and Advanced Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (spec. Engineering & CS), both from prestigious KU Leuven, Belgium. 

In my spare time I love doing sports; karate (JKA 1st Dan Black Belt), high-intensity fitness, cross country skiing in the wintertime, and table tennis all year round. Next to that, when I am away from the screen I enjoy listening to audiobooks, jazz music and admiring art.
