As the world bid farewell to 2021, for many, including myself it was a really good year, which has laid solid foundations for several new chapters to open in 2022.
 
First off, welcome to my refreshed website powered by Github Page and Jekyll. Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of it. 

As one of the items on the New Year resolutions list, this space shall serve for practicing applied writing in the forthcoming months and sharing the updates from applied research. 

Stay tuned!
