It is a great pleasure to share that two of the projects showcasing the use of NLP I was involved in have been published this year.

First is a book chapter [New Frontiers? Approaches to Computerized Text Analysis in Strategic Entrepreneurship Research][edgar-chapter] with Bill Wales.

Second is a team work published in the Journal of Corporate Finance [Unpacking the Black Box of ICO White Papers: A Topic Modeling Approach][jcf-ico2022] together with James Thewissen, Prabal Shrestha, and Wouter Torsin.
